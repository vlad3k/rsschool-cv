**My main goal is to become a demanded specialists like front-end engenieer.** 
I want to use modern technologies and tools to create high-quality products that will make people's lives easier.
It's important for me _everyday_ to learn new things and try to make my day better_the next day.
I want to know full cycle web development and development software, but for now I want to deep in frontend development . It's closer to me and when I can see result my works, it's motivate me. When I "get on my feet", I want to help beginers in to do it.
